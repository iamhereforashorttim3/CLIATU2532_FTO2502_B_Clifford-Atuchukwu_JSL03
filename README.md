# JSL03 Challenge

## Overview:
I have to create a simple task management system where users can create up to 3 tasks through prompts
that are stored within objects which are eventually stored into an already existing array.
Each task is meant to have a unique ID attached to it to differentiate from each other in case
of duplicates. 

## How to run:
* Download the files in the repository and place them within a folder
* Open VS Code and run the folder
* To test the prompts, press live view (If the prompts don't run, then reload the page)
* To see the "All Tasks" and "Completed Tasks" sections, inspect and go to the console

### Technology used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript

## Initial thoughts:
I came into this project very confident. Based off the overview that was given to me on the project page
it seemed to almost repeat of the previous project, but just with some added changes such as using objects,
and already having set tasks that needed to be added.

### Struggles:
* For this project, I didn't struggle as much but I just had to make some changes to some of the variables
for the sake of clarity.

* The only struggle that I can actually note was trying to add the new tasks and the old
combine the new and existing tasks into a single array, but through trial and error I eventually managed to make it work and everything runs
as intended.

* Not necessarily a struggle, but more so an issue that I try to fix from project to project. My commit messages,
I tend to code for very long periods without making too many commits and that is something I've been trying to do less and less.
